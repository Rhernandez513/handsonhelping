Hands On Helping spends 6 months a year in targeted areas of Cambodia searching out needy orphanages and directly assisting them.
We assess immediate needed items like water filtration, medicine and vitamins, school uniforms and supplies and food.
Another major goal of Hands On Helping is furthering childrens education and teaching them english.  In countries like Cambodia learning English is often key to finding employment opportunities.  
We currently have english teachers on site in Cambodia that are on our full time payroll.  These teachers also act as interpreters for visitors.
